"We only see what we want to see" - Convolutional Neural Networks are designed to work based on this ideology.

The idea was to train a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch using Tensorflow instead of following the straight forward approach of using the existing pre-trained models. This methodology was implemented in order to have an understanding of the fundamentals involved in an image recognition task.

The project was executed on Google Colab due to the underlying computational complexities.
